The Scientific Diet Selector is the ultimate tool to help your visitors choose personalised diets. It is science-backed, reliable, and lightweight.  

== Description ==
The Scientific Diet Selector is one of the few plugins that are <a target="_blank" href="http://scientificdiets.com/literature">backed by science.</a> It helps people find a great diet option based on their personal preferences. The match-making magic is enabled by a real-world dataset consisting of thousands of diet reviews by real humans - this is the real deal.. 

Thus, the plugin is both credible and useful: it actually works in choosing a diet. The plugin also comes with several powerful <a href="http://scientificdiets.com/monetize" target="_blank">monetization techniques</a> that you can use for marketing your own or affiliate products.

The Scientific Diet Selector does not force arbitrary formatting and CSS styling. It looks and feels as if it is a native part of your site, further adding to its appeal.
